An infected person may develop one or more symptoms simultaneously after three days. If the contaminated airborne particles and droplets spread randomly to four visitors sitting in a waiting room, what is the probability that all visitors developed at least one Covid-symptom after three days?*\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to model it as a probability distribution problem. We can think of this as distributing symptoms (or the virus) to the four visitors, where each visitor must receive at least one symptom.\n\nThis is similar to the occupancy problem we solved in Question 7, but with a twist: we don't have a fixed number of 'objects' (symptoms) to distribute. Instead, we need to consider the probability of each visitor developing at least one symptom independently.\n\nLet's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the probability of a single visitor developing at least one symptom.\n2. Then, we'll calculate the probability of all four visitors developing at least one symptom.\n\nFor step 1:\n- There are 7 possible symptoms.\n- The probability of not developing a specific symptom is the complement of developing it.\n- To not develop any symptom, a visitor must not develop each of the 7 symptoms.\n\n\n::: {.sourceClojure}\n```clojure\n(def num-symptoms 7)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.sourceClojure}\n```clojure\n(defn probability-no-symptoms [p]\n      (Math/pow (- 1 p) num-symptoms))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.sourceClojure}\n```clojure\n(defn probability-at-least-one-symptom [p]\n      (- 1 (probability-no-symptoms p)))\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor step 2:\n- All four visitors need to independently develop at least one symptom.\n- This is the same as the probability of one visitor developing a symptom, raised to the power of 4.\n\n\n::: {.sourceClojure}\n```clojure\n(defn probability-all-visitors-symptomatic [p]\n      (Math/pow (probability-at-least-one-symptom p) 4))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, let's calculate this probability for a range of p values, where p is the probability of developing each individual symptom:\n\n\n::: {.sourceClojure}\n```clojure\n(def p-values [0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5])\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.sourceClojure}\n```clojure\n(def probabilities-all-visitors\n  (map (fn [p] {:p p :probability (probability-all-visitors-symptomatic p)})\n       p-values))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.sourceClojure}\n```clojure\n(answer \"Probabilities for all visitors developing at least one symptom:\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n> <span style=\"color: black; font-size: 1.5em;\">**Probabilities for all visitors developing at least one symptom:**</span>\n\n\n::: {.sourceClojure}\n```clojure\n(into [] probabilities-all-visitors)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.printedClojure}\n```clojure\n[{:p 0.1, :probability 0.07407875407434654}\n {:p 0.2, :probability 0.3900627838302041}\n {:p 0.3, :probability 0.7090879995682614}\n {:p 0.4, :probability 0.8926403161374201}\n {:p 0.5, :probability 0.9691143073141575}]\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.sourceClojure}\n```clojure\n(doseq [p p-values]\n       (println (str \"For p = \" p \", the probability that all visitors\n  develop at least one symptom is approximately \"\n                     (format \"%.4f\" (probability-all-visitors-symptomatic\n                                           p)))))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.printedClojure}\n```clojure\nnil\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n1.
