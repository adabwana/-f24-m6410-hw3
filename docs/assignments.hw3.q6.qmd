## Question 6
---

#### *6) Let X be a continuous random variable with pdf $f(x)$ and cdf $F(x)$. For a fixed number $x_0$, define the function*

$$g(x) = \begin{cases} 
    \frac{f(x)}{1 - F(x_0)} & \text{if } x \geq x_0 \\
    0 & \text{if } x < x_0
\end{cases}$$

***Prove that $g(x)$ is a pdf (Assume that $F(x_0) < 1$.)***

To prove that $g(x)$ is a probability density function (pdf), we need to show two properties:

1. $g(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$
2. The integral of $g(x)$ over its entire domain equals 1

Let's prove each of these properties:

**1. Non-negativity: $g(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$**

For $x < x_0$, $g(x) = 0$, which satisfies the non-negativity condition.

For $x \geq x_0$:
- $f(x) \geq 0$ (since $f(x)$ is a pdf)
- $1 - F(x_0) > 0$ (since we're given that $F(x_0) < 1$)

Therefore, $g(x) = f(x) / (1 - F(x_0)) \geq 0$ for all $x \geq x_0$.

Thus, $g(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$.

**2. Integral of $g(x)$ equals 1**

Let's calculate the integral of $g(x)$ over its entire domain:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x) dx = \int_{-\infty}^{x_0} g(x) dx + \int_{x_0}^{\infty} g(x) dx$$

For the first part of the integral:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{x_0} g(x) dx = \int_{-\infty}^{x_0} 0 dx = 0$$

For the second part:

$$\int_{x_0}^{\infty} g(x) dx = \int_{x_0}^{\infty} \frac{f(x)}{1 - F(x_0)} dx$$

$$= \frac{1}{1 - F(x_0)} \int_{x_0}^{\infty} f(x) dx$$

$$= \frac{1}{1 - F(x_0)} [1 - F(x_0)]$$

$$= 1$$

The last step uses the fact that $\int_{x_0}^{\infty} f(x) dx = 1 - F(x_0)$, which is the probability that $X > x_0$.

Therefore, the total integral is:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x) dx = 0 + 1 = 1$$

> <span style="color: black; font-size: 1.5em;">**We have proven that $g(x)$ satisfies both conditions to be a pdf: it is non-negative for all $x$, and its integral over the entire domain equals 1.**</span>

**Interpretation:**

The function $g(x)$ represents the conditional probability density of $X$ given that $X \geq x_0$. This is why:

1. It's zero for $x < x_0$, as we're only considering the case where $X \geq x_0$.
2. For $x \geq x_0$, it's the original pdf $f(x)$ scaled up by a factor of $1 / (1 - F(x_0))$. This scaling ensures that the total probability for $X \geq x_0$ sums to 1.

This type of function is often used in survival analysis and reliability theory, where we're interested in the distribution of a variable given that it has survived up to a certain point.

**Conclusion:**

We have proven that $g(x)$ is indeed a valid probability density function. This result is important in probability theory and statistics, particularly when dealing with truncated or conditional distributions. It shows how we can derive a new pdf from an existing one by conditioning on a certain event (in this case, $X \geq x_0$). This concept has applications in various fields, including actuarial science, engineering reliability, and medical survival analysis.
