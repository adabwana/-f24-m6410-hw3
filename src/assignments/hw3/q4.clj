 (question "Question 4")

 (sub-question "4) Two players, A and B, alternately and independently flip a coin and the first player to obtain a head wins. Assume player A flips first.")

 (md "To solve this problem, let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. A wins on the first flip (probability 1/2)
2. If A doesn't win on the first flip, B flips. If B doesn't win, we're back to A's turn, but now in the same situation as at the start of the game.

Let p be the probability that A wins. We can write an equation:")

 (md "**Interpretation:**

1. When p = 0.5 (fair coin), we get the same result as in part (a): 2/3.
2. As p increases, A's probability of winning increases, which makes sense as A gets the first chance to flip.
3. As p approaches 1, A's probability of winning approaches 1, as A would almost certainly win on the first flip.
4. As p approaches 0, A's probability of winning approaches 1/2, as the game would likely go on for many flips, slightly favoring A who goes first.")

 (md "**Conclusion:**

We have derived, implemented, and verified formulas for the probability of player A winning in a coin-flipping game against player B, both for a fair coin and for a coin with an arbitrary probability of heads. The simulation results closely match our theoretical calculations, confirming the accuracy of our formula.

This problem demonstrates the application of probability in game theory and illustrates how initial advantages (going first) can affect the overall probability of winning in sequential games. It also showcases how simulations can be used to verify theoretical results in probability problems.")
